Hey AdHoc Team:

The SLCSP submission is written in Java 8 so please have Java 1.8 (or above) installed from:

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

Please choose Windows, Linux or Mac as appropriate.

Run the following file as an application: RunThis.java

This will pick up the slcsp.csv file, apply the rate and write it back into the file.

The 2 CSVs are located in:
/adhoc/resources folder.

Once you run RunThis.java, the slcsp.csv file will get updated, to revert this to original and try running again, copy empty (without rate) slcsp.csv from the homework git location and copy it over to:
/adhoc/resources/slcsp.csv.

Thank you!
